stripped theme for Piwigo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author : Julien Capitaine (Zaphod on Piwigo forums)

stripped theme is designed as a simple, clean theme, in order to focus on the images.
This theme comes with 3 different styles (original, black, white) and several options are available on the configuration page.
(Admin/Configuration/Themes -> stripped Configuration)

It includes an automatic image sizing to be able view the whole image even on small screens,
and an image preloading system to permit faster browsing.

It is originally based on "simple black" theme by Sa√Ømon <contact@saimon.org>,
and has been influenced by Gally theme (by Grum) and Luciano Amodio theme
(by P@t and AdamQuadmon).
Thanks to the authors!
